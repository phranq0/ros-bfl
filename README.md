# ros-bfl
ROS workspace for testing and experimenting Bayesian filtering algorithms (Particle filters, Kalman filters)
Requires an up-and-running version of the Orocos Bayesian Filtering Library (BFL), better if installed within ROS (valid only for Kinetic and Melodic)

The examples are built using a kinematic point-shaped robot included in bfl

Up to now only basic Bootstrap Particle Filter simulation is implemented
